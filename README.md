# Hamptons Hospital EHR

Welcome! If you are looking for the user manual, you can find it
[here](https://github.com/JasonMFry/hamptons_hospital_ehr_user_manual/blob/master/user_manual.md).
If you want to request a feature or a change to the EHR, go to
[Issues](https://github.com/JasonMFry/hamptons_hospital_ehr_user_manual/blob/master/user_manual.md)
and click the big green button that says "New issue". If you want to
make a change yourself to the user manual, go
[here](https://github.com/JasonMFry/hamptons_hospital_ehr_user_manual/edit/master/user_manual.md)
and you can make edits right in your browser. Once you are finished,
scroll to the bottom, give a short subject of what you changed, and
a longer description of why you made the change, and click the big
green button.
